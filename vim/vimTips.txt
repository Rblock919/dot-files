                                        Ryan Vim Cheatsheet

    -- Random Commands --
% -> bounces around to start/ends of code blocks (if elses, etc)
o (in visual mode) -> alternates which end of the visual block to extend
:noh -> turn off highlighting until next search

    -- Window Commands --
ctrl + w + 

    -- Find letter occurance --
fX (x being the letter searched for)
FX (find prev occurance) 
: , (navigate finds) "asdf"

    -- Search -- 
/ -> search forward
? -> search backwards
n/N -> next/prev match
*/# -> if already on word, search for next/prev occurances
^> exact matches, use g*/g# to find word as a part of a potentially larger word
^> append '/+4' to go to 4 lines below match or '/e+4' to go 4 characters after match (- also works)
can prepend operators such as delete, yank, visual, change
^> d/Vim/e -> delete from cursor to end of next 'Vim' match

    -- Search & Replace --
:%s/search/replace
^> append a 'g' to make it global, others flags include c (confirm), i (ignore case), I (case-sensitive), n (show number of matches), p (print matching lines) gglobal
* if search string is not given then last used search string will be used
* if replacement string is not given will just delete the occurances
* omit % to only search on current line, % searches current file

    -- Search & Execute --
:[range]g[lobal]/{pattern}/[cmd]

    -- Screen Movement --
Ctrl-y Moves screen up one line
Ctrl-e Moves screen down one line
Ctrl-u Moves cursor & screen up ½ page
Ctrl-d Moves cursor & screen down ½ page
Ctrl-b Moves screen up one page, cursor to last line
Ctrl-f Moves screen down one page, cursor to first line
*Ctrl-y and Ctrl-e only change the cursor position if it would be moved off screen*

    -- Folding --
z + M(all) R(all) c(close) o(open) a(toggle) k(move up) j(move down)

    -- Registers --
:reg - list registers
""p - paste last thing in register (in normal mode)
"0p - paste 2nd to last thing in register (can go all the way up to "9p)
* deleting something places it in the un-named register, so that can be easily overridden

* perform any # of commands *
q -> (quit recording)

then last change here

@a -> execute recording 'a'
@@ -> execute last recording
